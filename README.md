![HighSideFet](https://github.com/Ccecil/Flambegate/assets/1588588/c1255bb0-c71a-46f3-be1e-3e0bb6d962e2)

Flambegate is an attempt at adding hardware failsafes to 3d printers to add a layer of protection above and beyond what the standard hardware does.  This adds a "highside fet control" to the hotend so that it can be shutdown in case of fault.
